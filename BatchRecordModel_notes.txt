1. The template file (SMIDB.templates:{"$oid":"66ea36c6966098b64c0f95d9"}.json) defines the structure of a specific batch record template, including sections and fields.

2. The BatchRecord model (models/BatchRecord.js) represents the overall batch record, linking to a template and tracking its status.

3. The BatchRecordData model (models/BatchRecordData.js) stores the actual data for each section of a batch record.

4. The API routes handle data fetching and updating:
app/api/batch-records/route.js fetches a list of batch records.
app/api/[templateName]/[batchRecordId]/sections/route.js retrieves sections for a specific batch record.
app/api/[templateName]/[batchRecordId]/[sectionName]/route.js handles getting and updating data for a specific section.

5. The MainContent component (components/MainContent.jsx) renders the form for a specific section, using the DataSheetGrid to display and edit the data.
